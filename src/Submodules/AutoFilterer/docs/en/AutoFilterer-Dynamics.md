# AutoFilterer Dynamics
AutoFilterer Dynamics aims to generate LINQ expressions dynamically without defining a filter class. Property names and comparisons will be dynamic.

> This feature is under development. You can try it via installing [AutoFilterer.Dynamics](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AutoFilterer.Dynamics) package to your project.

*This way of filtering isn't recommended since it's against of the OpenAPI Specification.*
